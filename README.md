# EchoTransformer: The Future of Conversational AI

EchoTransformer is a groundbreaking multimodal AI model that revolutionizes natural language processing and image understanding. Built on a New, Dynamic and an advanced transformer architecture, it seamlessly integrates cutting-edge techniques in reinforcement learning, memory mechanisms, and multimodal fusion.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multimodal Mastery**: Effortlessly processes both text and images.
- **Dynamic Encoder-Decoder**: Utilizes sparse and hierarchical attention for unparalleled understanding.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Reinforcement learning module for continuous improvement.
- **Memory Powerhouse**: Enhanced long-term information retention and retrieval.
- **Advanced Tokenization**: Custom tokenizer with TF-IDF scoring for nuanced text representation.
- **Fusion Reactor**: Dedicated module for seamless text and image feature combination.

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vertexcorp/EchoTransformer.git
    cd EchoTransformer
    ```

2. **Install the requirements**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Train the model**:

    ```python
    from train_transformer import train_echo_transformer

    config = {
        "learning_rate": 0.001,
        "batch_size": 32,
        "epochs": 10,
        "model_size": "base"
    }

    train_echo_transformer(config)
    ```

4. **Use the trained model**:

    ```python
    from model_service import ModelService

    model_service = ModelService(config)
    response = model_service.generate("Tell me about this image", image_input=your_image_tensor)
    print(response)
    ```

## üí° Why EchoTransformer?

- **Versatile**: EchoTransformer can handle both text and image inputs, enabling richer and more versatile interactions compared to text-only models.
- **Efficient**: The sparse attention and dynamic processing techniques in EchoTransformer can potentially offer better performance on limited hardware resources.
- **Cutting-Edge**: Incorporates the latest advancements in AI and NLP.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to specific use cases and domains.
