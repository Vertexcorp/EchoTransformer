# EchoTransformer

EchoTransformer is an advanced, multimodal AI model that combines state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques with image processing capabilities. It builds upon the transformer architecture, incorporating reinforcement learning, memory mechanisms, and multimodal fusion to create a versatile and powerful AI system.

## Features

- **Multimodal Processing**: Handles both text and image inputs seamlessly.
- **Dynamic Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: Utilizes advanced attention mechanisms, including sparse and hierarchical attention.
- **Reinforcement Learning Module**: Enables adaptive learning and performance improvement over time.
- **Memory Bank**: Enhances long-term information retention and retrieval.
- **Advanced Tokenization**: Custom tokenizer with TF-IDF scoring for nuanced text representation.
- **Multimodal Fusion**: Dedicated module for combining text and image features.

## Components

- `echo_transformer.py`: Core transformer architecture implementation.
- `model.py`: Main EchoTransformer model definition.
- `model_service.py`: High-level interface for model usage.
- `multimodal.py`: Multimodal fusion implementation.
- `reinforcement.py`: Reinforcement learning module.
- `tokenizer.py`: Advanced tokenization system.
- `train_transformer.py`: Training script for EchoTransformer.

## Usage

### To train the model:

```python
from train_transformer import train_echo_transformer

config = {
    # Define configuration parameters
}
train_echo_transformer(config)
```

### To use the trained model:

```python
from model_service import ModelService

model_service = ModelService(config)
output = model_service.generate("Your input text here", image_input=your_image_tensor)
```
